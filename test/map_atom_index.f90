! This subroutine processes typat, which is an array that stores the type index of each atom, 
! and generates several other arrays:
! 1. nattyp : this is an array of size ntype, which stores how many atoms there are of each type
! 2. atindx : 'index table' of atoms, which creates an alternative order of atoms based on order of types
! 3. atindx1 : the inverse of atindx

! For example, a CH4 molecule where type 1 is H, type 2 is C, and typat is given by 2 1 1 1 1
! then nattyp is (4 1)
! atindx is (5 1 2 3 4), where the H atoms are ordered before the C atom
! and atindx1 is (2 3 4 5 1), because, for example, '1' is the 2nd element in array atindx
