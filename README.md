# libpaw_interface
Trying to write an inteface for the libpaw library from ABINIT, which can be transferred more easily to other SCF softwares

## Acknowledgments
The subroutines are mostly gathered from 42_libpaw and 65_paw from the ABINIT software. I have made some modifications so that this module can be compiled individually
